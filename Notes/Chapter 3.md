- Chapter 3
- SHO-BATTAI

- Ate leg as soon as reached gate
- Daydream about having 2 dos
- while talking to nomad trader
- We run into a bunch of dead skimmers, like before.
- We did not see the fight.
- Do the same meat drop trick like I normally do.
- This is going to be the futhest I have ever left Tobi unattended
- Loot all the tusks.
- Hive traders run up
- Don't go into the mist, no-hive!"

- "...Unless you have Hive lantern with you. We have one you can have if you want to go there. not free though.
- "......Mists?....What?"
- "North of Vain, north of the Hive. No-hives call it the Deathyard. It's full of ancient treasures! But you need a lantern to travel through...
- "And if I don't have a lantern?
- "I already told you, no-hive! You won't come back out."
- "How Much"
- "2500 Cats. This is a good price, no-hive. You can't put a price on safety."
- "I don't have that much money.
- "This is a special discount, no-hive. This is a good deal! Here, take a looks at it..."
- "I told you, I don't have enough money..."
- "...
- before he could say anything
- "I'm going! Take a hint already..."
- "you're going? How rude. Why would you not accept our offer?"
- "We gave you special price as well! Just for you...You insult the Queen!"
- "Curse you, no-hive! The mists will swallow you whole! You'll DIE!"
- As you walk away
- YOU'LL NEVER COME BACK OUT
- YOU'LL REGRET This

- That crazy hive guy had kept me preoccupied long enough.
- I needed to sprint back to Stoat and sell these tusks.
- I make it back.
- I sell it to an archer named Hew.
- His shop is the closest.
- I walked out with about 3500 cats, and the recipe for regular bolts.
- I needed to run back to Tobi stat
- I made it back, picked up all the dry meat.
- And that one GreenFruit that that samurai had gave me.
- While I was picking up meat, a skimmer woke up
- it attacked me instead of the hive around.
- may be I should have bought their stupid lamp.
- As I ran, TObi picked up aggression.
- He tried to defend me, but with one blow to the chest, He went down.
- The mercenaries started fighting the monster at that point, while I ran to fix my wounded friend.
- I bandaged him, picked him up, and started caryhing him to wherever the next town is.
- he was in recovery and would be for a while.
- Ran into an Nomad Animal Trader again. Had a little chat with him.

- "Ho Townie. I have animals for sale."
- "Do I need to feed them?"
- "Of course you need to feed them, you chump. They'll eat anything you do and more. Eat right out of your backpacks they will.
- "Do they eat a lot? I don't know if I can afford to feed them."
- "The young ones ain't so bad. They'll eat more as they grow up, but itf they're carryin' a bag on their backs you can carry more food around can't ya? Can't live without 'em on a long journey.
