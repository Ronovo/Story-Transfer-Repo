**Chapter 2** 

***Stoat***

They had not made it to Stoat yet, but they had encountered a problem. Some starving vagrants had seen them and wanted to beat them up. However, they chose the wrong squad to fight with. 

They had no weapons, while Ronovo had a rusted iron club as a side arm. His main weapon, the Horse Chopper, had been pawned for food a few days ago. And of course, he had Tobi.

They charged instead of running away. Ronovo took the one in the front, while Tobi attacked the one in the back.

Tobi was taking massive damage out of the vagrants leg. The poor vagrant tried to crawl away, but Tobi grabbed him, and mawled him, so that he could not crawl anywhere. The vagrant fell unconscious, most likely from the pain.

Ronovo, meanwhile, was not doing great. While far from losing, he had taken a few fists to the face that had hurt. For every hit he landed with his club, he got socked in the face. Tobi ran over to Ronovo, attacking the standing Vagrant. With Tobi taking the aggression, Ronovo broke away, and ran to the unconcious Vagrent. He quickly looted him, grabbing his Rag Skirt and Black Rag Shirt. 

Ronovo ran back over, and hit the vagrant from behind. Together, Tobi and Ronovo had fell the last vagant. This one was playing dead, thinking the squad would stop attacking him. However, Ronovo could see through the charade. He quickly looted the body, and picked up the Vagrant. 

"I got a special plan for you. Let's hope Stoat has a market."

Ronovo quickly bandaged up his head. His right eye was black and a bit swollen, but other then that, he would be fine. Nothing a little sleep won't fix. However, he could walk just fine. Together with Tobi, they set up North. Not 30 steps later, they saw Stoat arise like a mirage on the horizion. The tell-tale windmills and walls of the civilized world. 

"Looks like we made it, boy!"
