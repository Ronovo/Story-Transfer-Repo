# A Man and His Dog : A Kenshi Playthrough Story

**Chapter 2** 

***Stoat***

They had not made it to Stoat yet, but they had encountered a problem. Some starving Vagrants had seen them and wanted to beat them up. However, they chose the wrong squad to fight with. 

They had no weapons, while Ronovo had a rusted iron club as a side arm. His main weapon, the Horse Chopper, had been pawned for food a few days ago. And of course, he had Tobi.

They charged instead of running away. Ronovo took the one in the front, while Tobi attacked the one in the back.

Tobi was taking massive damage out of the Vagrant's leg. The poor Vagrant tried to crawl away, but Tobi grabbed him, and mauled him, so that he could not crawl anywhere. The vagrant fell unconscious, most likely from the pain.

Ronovo, meanwhile, was not doing as great. While far from losing, he had taken a few fists to the face that had hurt. For every hit he landed with his club, he got socked in the face. Tobi ran over to Ronovo, attacking the standing Vagrant. With Tobi taking the aggression, Ronovo broke away, and ran to the unconcious Vagrent. He quickly looted him, grabbing his Rag Skirt and Black Rag Shirt. 

Ronovo ran back over, and hit the standing Vagrant from behind. He too, fell to the ground. However, This one was playing dead, thinking the squad would stop attacking him. Ronovo could see through the charade. He quickly looted the body, and picked him up

"I got a special plan for you. Let's hope Stoat has a market."

Ronovo quickly bandaged up his head. His right eye was black and a bit swollen, but other then that, he would be fine. Nothing a little sleep won't fix. He could walk just fine. Together with Tobi, they set out North. Not 30 steps later, they saw Stoat arise like a mirage on the horizion. The tell-tale windmills and walls of the civilized world. 

"Looks like we made it, boy!"

*bark*

*******************************

As they came in the city, and night began to fall, Ronovo started scanning the buildings. He saw the two things he had been looking for: a tavern, and a slave market.

First, he ran to the market. No one greeted him as he walked in. However, he heard someone snoring behind the partitions. Running around them, he shook the Slave Boss awake. 

"Hey, wake up. I'm here to do buisness."

"Huh...." he said, groggily. 

"C'mon, I got a new prisoner for you."

The Boss perked up at this, finally coming into the land of the living. 

"Watchya got there? A new slave? Give you 400 Cats for 'em"

"Sure, man. Whatever you wanna call 'em. Just give me the money."

As he handed over the Vagrant, the Boss gave him 400 Cats. "Come to Master" he cackled. Ronovo watched as he threw him in a cage. He then bent down and started performing first aid on him. Two more guards ran over: One started bandaging the Vagrant, while the other started putting shackles on him. That's all he had to see. Money is money.

He whistled, and Tobi came running. "Let's go get some food" he said, jingling his newly filled money sack. They ran towards the Tavern. As he walked in, he ran to the counter. "Excuse me, sir. I'd like to buy some food."

"Sure thing." said the Barkeeper. Ronovo traded him the robe he had taken off the Vagrants, and bought as much dried meat as he could carry. Estatic about his good luck, he ran outside to celebrate with his best friend.

"Look at all this meat we have, Tobi!"

***BARK BARK*** Tobi exclaimed as he ran around in a circle. 

They ran over to a corner by the gate. He proceeded to drop all the meet on the ground. Tobi ran over to him and started eating it. "Ok, boy. I want you to guard the meat. Don't let anyone take it, and you can have as much as you want!" He pet the dog on the head as the dog excitedly licked his hand.

Since he had no place to call home, and he wasn't hurting too bad from the fight earlier, he decided he would try to do some more scavaging. Luckily, he didn't have to wait long. As soon as he walked out of the gate, he saw a Skimmer off in the distance. He couldn't fight it on his own, but if he could lure it to the gate, haveing the guards kill it. He could then get its tusk to sell, and its meat as a treat for his friend. 

Luckily, this Skimmer was hungry. It charged Ronovo as soon as he was seen. Ronovo hauled ass back to the gate. The Skimmer was gaining quickly, but he was able to outrun it. The plan went off without a hitch. Like clockwork, the guards ran out, and within 5 seconds, had made quick work of the beast. Ronovo ran over, looted it, then ran back to town. 

He stopped by Tobi, and threw him one of the pieces of raw Skimmer meat. Tobi eagerly ran over and woofed it down in three bites. Ronovo pet him. "Good job guarding the food. I am going to go sell these tusks real quick. Be right back!" After a quick trip to the tavern, he had sold off all the Skimmer tusks and had about 1000 cats to his name. So far, so good. 

He ran back once again to Tobi. "Let's go find some more fights, boy." he said, as he picked up the meat.

***Bark Bark Bark*** came the enthusiastic reply

*******************************

They set out, running around the perimeter of the city, looking for patrols out in the cool desert night. While they wandered, Ronovo thought about what he would be doing next. He didn't plan on staying in Stoat for the rest of his life. There is only so much scavaging he can do, and there did not seem to be any copper deposits he was seeing.

 "Bark if you see anything, Tobi. I'm going to take a look at the map". Now that they were in a secure location, he could really study it. 

The first thing he noticed is that there was a coastline on the edge of the Great Desert. Ronovo had never seen the ocean before. At least, he didn't remember ever seeing it. However, that was about to change. He would head all the way north to the coastline, then follow it until he found a city. Whatever city he found, that would be his home. Maybe he will find more towns along the way. 

He was interrupted by a loud **BARK**. As he put away the map, he saw that a few feet away, there was a pack of Skimmers, and he had almost walked headlong into them. 

He walked back towards the gate. They had made it to the gate on the other side of the city from where they had originally entered. Ronovo found another corner to drop off his food. He needed to find a home soon, so he didn't have to keep doing this. 

"You know the drill, Tobi. Same deal as last time."

He ran off before he could get a *bark* in reply. He couldn't let the Skimmers get away. As he ran out of the gate, he started yelling at the Skimmers. "Hey, you ugly son of a bitch, OVER HERE!!!" One of them seemed to take notice of him, but every time it started running to him, it would back off. Maybe it saw the gate and wasn't willing to take the risk like it's brethern had. That was fair. 

Luck was on his side. As he watched the Skimmers walk off, he saw a Slaver Caravan come up over the horizon. Both squads were on a collision course. He looked on and watched as the Caravan got torn to pieces. He only did what he needed to survive. Watching those that took slaves as a full time job get torn to pieces was pretty satisfying. He didn't have time to stare for long. He had to loot before the entire caravan was wiped out.

He ran to the bodies, and started looting them as quickly as he could. However, in his rush, he wasn't paying attention. The Skimmer had destoryed the caravan, and now had his sights set on Ronovo. He tried to run, but all the loot he had grabbed was slowing him down. "Shit", he thought , "is this the end for me?"

As a last ditch effort, he dropped his backpack and all the loot in it. All the extra weight had been slowing him down, and with the extra boost of speed, he was just barely able to start pulling ahead of the monster. He could hear it lungeing at him as he ran. Luckily, he made it to the gates in time, and the guards made quick work of the Skimmer. 

He ran back out of the gates, and looted the body. He then ran back out to the battlefield, and picked up all his loot he dropped. He had no clue how he got out of that skirmish alive, but he was glad he did.

On the way back, he saW a severed human arm on the ground. It must have been left behind by one of the Slave Traders. He picked it up, and took it with him. "I can't wait to see how Tobi is going to react to this." He said, with a grin.

*******************************

As he got back into the city gates, He took the arm out of his backpack, and walked over to Tobi and the meat. He hid it behind his back quickly, so it would be a surpise. "Hey Tobi. You did sooooo good when I was gone. I see you didn't eat all of our meat. I brought you a little treat!"

As he whipped out the arm from behind his back, Tobi started jumping up and down with happiness. ***BARK BARK...BARK BARK BARK***. He jumped up, and grabbed the arm of out Ronovo's hand. He ran off holding the arm in his mouth, playing with it, barking the whole way. He was the happiest bone dog in all of Stoat, maybe even the United Cities.

Ronovo left him to play while he finished up selling off the loot. At the end of the day, he had 2000 cats. "Not a bad little down payment on a beachside house", he thought. A smile grew on his face as he watched his best friend run around the city.
