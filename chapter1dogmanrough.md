**Chapter 1** 

***A Man and His Dog***

Ronovo awoke to Tobi licking his face. A smile spread across it as he reached out to pet the bonedog.

Through the opening in the roof, the morning sun bathed the house in light. Ronovo had found this house in the far corner of Bast when he had wandered here a few days ago. Most of the houses had been completely destroyed, but this one was still standing. Though it was in disarry, it had a roof, and it's position was advantageous. It was situatated in a canyon cutout, so there were walls on 3 sides. With one way in and out of town, he felt pretty safe sleeping there for a few days. 

He had found a sleeping bag, left by some traders that had been there before. They smelled strongly of packbeast, but beggers can't be choosers. His stomach let out a low grumble. He made his way over the food barrel, and looked inside. There should have been a piece of meat left in there, but it seemed to be gone.

He stared at Tobi, and Tobi stared back at him. "Tobi...." he accused. 

Tobi's face never changed. Eyes blank, tongue hanging out, playing dumb.

"Did you eat the last steak we had?"

Tobi let out a low bark, as if voicing his protest. 

"Must have been the ghosts, right?" he quipped. 

The blank look returned.

"Oh well. Looks like it's time to find some more, huh? C'mon. Let's hit the road."

Tobi answered by barking enthusiastically.

Opening the door, Ronovo was blasted by sand flying in at him. He didn't worry about the course sand getting everywhere. He didn't plan on coming back for a while. Stepping outside,he surveyed the town of Bast. He didn't know what caused the town to be destroyed, but whatever had caused this destruction was long gone. Most of the buildings had collapsed roofs. Ronovo had sifted through the rubble in some of them when he had first arrived, and had found a few pieces of dried meat. They ate like kings for 2 days after, but the town was now barren. If they didn't move on soon, there was a good chance he would die from starvation.

He was very malnourished. Before the discovery of the meat, they had not seen food in 3 to 4 days. His existance was moment to moment. He didn't have time to ponder his past, nor plan for his future. His strength had withered away with his body, as did his memories. However, there are some memories that never fade

**************

Ronovo's lungs burned as he ran. He didn't hear any yelling behind him, and he believed he was safe. He ducked behind a rock and took a second to catch his breath. There were no stars in the sky, and the only illumination he had as the moon above him. Opening the backpack that had put him in this situation, his eyes sparkled at the spoils.

Inside was a loaf of bread, as well as 6 pieces of dried meat. He scarfed down the loaf of bread in seconds, then prepared to eat a piece of meat when a cry rung out across the desert.

"I think I heard something over here!" a voice yelled close by. 

With a deep breath in and out, Ronovo braced to sprint again. Peaking over the boulder, he saw an Outlaw Swordsman advancing towards him. Further off, the rest of his squad was advancing fast. He had to get out of here fast or he was toast.

As he took off, the swordsman yelled "I FOUND HIM!! EVERYONE, ON ME!". He could hear the footsteps speed up behind him as the swordsman began pursuit. 

With the headstart he had, Ronovo weaved over the massive sand mounds, hoping to lose his fate in the high ridges. As he crested another one, he stopped in his tracks. About 100 yards away were 3 massive Skimmers advancing in his direction. They had not seen him yet, but if he didn't act fast, they would be making a beeline towards him. He could not turn around, lest he face the wrath of the Outlaw Farmers. 

There was a ridge to his right that he could run over. If there was no cover there, he would be screwed. However, there were a lot of Outlaws behind him, and the thought of robbing their dead bodies after they run into the Skimmers was too appetizing to pass up. Luckily, as he crested the ridge, he saw some more rocks he could hide behind. He hunkered down and waiting for the bloodshed to begin.

Over the ridge, he could hear the Outlaws crest the ridge.

"SKIMMERS!!!" A voice cried out. A skimmer screech pierced the night as they descended upon the group of surpised Outlaws.
