A Man and His Dog
- Hiding behind a rock, he thinks they are off his tail.
- Trying to catch his breath, he opened his backpack
- Inside was the food his pursuers were after.
- With a growling stomach, he reached in, and devoured a loaf of bread.
- However, his elation did not last long
- not far off, he heard the bark of bonedogs
- The outlaws were onto him. 
- He began running again
- Ahead of him, there were was a patorl of Skimmers. 
- Turning around, he saw the torches of the outlaws approaching
- Talk about being caught between a rock and a hard place.
- He saw a ridge he could run over to the south of him, and hide out behind the rocks on the other side.
- He didn't see the carnage, but from the screams of the outlaws, it sounded like they had met the skimmers
- As the skimmers walked off from their victory, Ronovo ran over to the bodies. 
- All of them were dead or dying, except for one bonedog. 
- As he was stealing a horse chopper off a swordsman, he heard the whimpering.
- With bandages he had robbed from the dead outlaws, he patched up the dog.
- I am going to call you Tobi
